    <h1>Angel Ali</h1>
    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
  
    <p>My name is Angel Ali! I'm a family guy, martial arts guy, normal video gamer, ex military guy, ex sales guy.</p>
    
    <p> I have three children, a giant cat, and my wife. We've been married for ten years and met in high school. Everything I do is for my family to ensure they have an amazing way of life. I continue to stay military minded for most things I do and it is now my mission to master programming for my family's sake.</p>

    <p>I'm used to doing heavy labor all the time, as I've been doing it for 12 years non-stop, so this is new to me. Before the military I worked for moving companies and construction labor. I was in a Cavalry unit in the Army. It was a very strict unit of the Army where I learned martial arts and continued to teach it in civilian life! Which gets you broke very quickly. After 4 years of the Army, I did 4 years of sales management for Discount Tire Company.</p>

    <p>I've grown tired of sales and labor and want to learn something interesting and more advanced so I don't have to be a labor guy forever. With programming, maybe I can take care of my body <b>AND</b> provide the awesome lifestyle for my family. I am very grateful to the school, and to the VA for this opportunity. </p>
